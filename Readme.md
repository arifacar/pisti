Pişti (pronounced "pishti") is a popular Turkish card game, using a standard 52 card pack.

Cards are played to a central pile, which can be captured by matching the previous card played or playing a jack. Points are scored for certain captured cards. The word "pişti", which means "cooked", describes a capture of a pile containing only one card, for which extra points are scored.
